# Research-Methodology

Creation of a Deep Learning model requires knowledge, time, and computational power to figure out the best configuration of a neural network. This process is called hyper-parameter optimization and can be automated with search algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, which are inspired by Darwinâ€™s Theory of Evolution. These are based on the concept that a pool of parents with the best genes produce better offspring. The objective of this study is to check if the weight merge technique of producing the best genes can be used to improve the performance of genetic algorithms applied in hyper-parameter optimization. We can hence define a genetic algorithm and a tool that can be used in future studies to speed up execution time of fitness function while maintaining accuracy of the results.

This project builds one such tool that uses weight merge technique for hyperparameter optimization using Genetic Algorithm.
